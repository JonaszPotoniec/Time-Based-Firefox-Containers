## Instalation
### Firefox:  
You can install it from the [firefox addon page](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/copy-yarn-in-npmjs-com/).  
  
### Chrome:  
I don't have a chrome developer account so you'll need to install this extension [manually](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).
